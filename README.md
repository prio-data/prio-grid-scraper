# prio-grid-scraper

A simple way to download all of the raw data that makes up PRIOgrid.  Should be
maintained to keep all links alive and well, will implement some sort of
automatic warning system that lets us know whenever links fail.

This scraper should end up as a oneliner, but this might be made complicated by
the fact that some sites require registration and / or email verification.  In
those cases it might be necessary to simply point to the files, however, we
will try to avoid this.

Any questions to pglandsverk@gmail.com
